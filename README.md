# User Experience (UX)
## Project Goals
The primary goal of WanderMorocco is to provide an engaging and informative platform for users to explore the diverse aspects of Moroccan culture. Whether visitors are planning a trip, learning about Moroccan history, or simply browsing, the site is designed to be intuitive and informative.

## Target Audience

- Cultural enthusiasts
- General users with an interest in learning about Morocco

## User Stories
- First-Time Visitor Goals:
  - As a first-time visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site immediately.

## Design
### Color Scheme
The color scheme of the website includes warm earth tones inspired by the Moroccan landscape. These include deep reds, oranges, and browns, which evoke the Sahara Desert and traditional Moroccan architecture.

### Typography
The website uses a cursive font style to evoke a personal diary feel while reflecting modern elements of Moroccan culture. The primary font is Handlee, chosen for its readability and cursive appearance. A secondary cursive-style font complements Handlee, enhancing the clean, personal feel of the site.

### Imagery
Imagery plays a crucial role in the WanderMorocco website. High-resolution photos of Moroccan architecture and landscapes, most of which were taken by me, are used throughout the site to immerse users in the Moroccan experience and enhance its authenticity.

### Videos
The website features two YouTube videos that provide additional insights into Moroccan history beyond the text content. Both videos only start playing when the user clicks on them.
